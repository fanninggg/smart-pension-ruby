# Logfile Data Extractor

A ruby app to extract information about page views, unique users and more from logfiles via the terminal.

## Usage

To get started using the logfile data extractor:
1. git clone git@github.com:fanninggg/smart-pension-ruby.git
2. bundle install
3. ruby app.rb

In order to get info from a new log file:
1. Add a new logfile to the data folder
2. Change the selected file in the app.rb as below
